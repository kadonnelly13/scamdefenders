## Raise Awareness

One of the best ways to help protect against is to bring awareness to individuals about the dangers out there. Talk to them about the most common type of scams today and let them know how they typically work. These include:

- Outstanding bill that needs to be paid for a service immediately
- Unsolicited message about wanting to get into a romantic relationship
- Impersonating a loved one

A few good rules of thumb are:

- If you personally don't know an individual don't engage with them
- If you have never used or heard of a product or service before then you don't owe them money

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a good list of common scans [1] that is a good read to help drive a conversation. During that conversation it would also be good to review common phishing scams which the Federal Trade Commission has a good walkthrough [2].

With the rise of AI the scam landscape is rapidly evolving and scammers are using this technology for bad such as cloning voices of loved ones [3].

## Install a Browser Ad-Blocker

Lots of times scams can come from ads throughout the internet. Installing an ad-blocker in their browsers helps to reduce that attack surface for scammers. If possible try to install an ad-blocker on all of the web browsers available to the device not just their default browser. The most trusted ad-blocker is uBlock Origin which can be installed for all browsers but there are other alternatives as well.

- [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/)
- [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/)

## Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication, also commonly known as two-factor authentication, is key for ensuring that if account credentials get compromised then it will be harder for a bad actor to get remote access. Nowadays all major websites have some form of MFA available but there is a handy website called [2fa.directory](https://2fa.directory/us/) that aggregates what websites you can enable MFA on.

There are multiple different forms of secondary authentication methods so choosing one is better than none. Below is the most common methods in ranked order, from best to less-best, of these methods.

1. Hardware security token such as a [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) or [Titan Security Key](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/titan-security-key)
2. [Time-based one-time password (TOTP)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp)
3. SMS and email tokens

## Manage and Use Passwords Securely

While this means different things to different people, Cybersecurity & Infrastrcuture Security Agency (CISA) has three straightforward tips [1]:

1. Try to use at least 16 characters in a password
2. Either make them totally random characters or use passphrases
3. Do not reuse passwords across different accounts

A few more things to emphasize is with your loved one is to never share any passwords with anyone else. No-one will ever ask you for your password from an organization or reputable source that they work for.

Nowadays there is a class of tools called password managers that as the name suggests, help manage passwords. As these tools become more common at work and at home you can have a family plan where you can also help share login information and passwords across groups of people. A couple of options include:

- [1Password](https://1password.com/) (Paid)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (Paid)
- [Keepass](https://keepass.info/) (Free)

## Block Incoming Phone Calls That Don't Have a Contact

One of the best ways to protect against spam calls is to just block all of them to their cell phone if there isn't an existing contact. This does impact recieving phone calls from unknown phone numbers that would like to be recieved .

- [Android Devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/8675177?hl=en&msgid=8676481)

## Use a Secure DNS Provider

Another option for helping secure at the device level is to setup their devices to use a secure DNS provider. These providers will attempt to block known bad domains which could help protect against websites that are stood up by scammers.

## Use a Reputable Email Provider

While it is still common to utilize email addresses provided by telecomms companies like Comcast or SBC Global it is probably a good idea to migrate to a more modern provider like GMail, Outlook, or Apple mail. This is also a good oppurtunity to have a clean start and reduce the spam messgaes that are most likely being sent.

## General Secure Computer and Phone Hygiene

It is a good idea to do a regular cleanup of computers and phones of individuals you might be concerned about.

1. Review all installed apps and remove unecessary or suspicious ones
2. Ensure that passcode and passwords to access the actual device are setup
3. Apply operating system patchs and update the latest version. If that is not possible then it might be time to get a new device for this individual
4. Update all of the installed apps to the latest versions

# Recovering from an Online Scam

If you believe that a loved one is actively being scammed online it might be appropriate to take immediate steps. The FTC also has a very good guide [1] that should be referenced as well.

1. Ask them to turn-off or unplug their computer
2. Call their banks and let them know this is hapenning so they can freeze accounts
3. Warn them to not interact with any additional phone calls, emails, or text messages

These are critical steps to try and stop the scammers in their tracks. Typically a scammer will request some sort of remote access and turning off the computer is the best way to stop them from being able to access it. Being able to go to physically to the computer to review what happened is ideal. The next best option, while counter-intuitive and may have gotten them in this position, is to install TeamViewer to remotely access their computer.

## Next Steps

After the immediate risks have been handled it is time to recovery from this scamming incident. One of the key steps is to empathize with the victim in this scenario. They are probably feeling very self-concious right now and have a wide range of emotions. The least you can do is go in with a good attitude, not shame them, and try to uplift the mood if possible.

1. [Reset all passwords for critical accounts and enable MFA](#reset-all-passwords-for-critical-accounts--enable-mfa)
2. [Search for Installed Remote Software](#search-for-installed-remote-software)
3. [Review Browser History and Disable Notifications](#review-browser-history-and-disable-notifications)
4. [Cleanup of Computer](#cleanup-of-computer)

### Reset All Passwords for Critical Accounts & Enable MFA

For all banking, email, and other critical accounts it is best to immediatly reset all account passwords and enable MFA where possible. It is difficult to trace down what they might have had access to and for what period of time if there was a remote software tool involved.

### Search for Installed Remote Software

This is the primary way that a scammer will gain access to a computer of a victim. There are many free tools that are used and can be installed very easily. While these are legitimate tools they can be used in malicious fashion.

Below is a list of tools for desktops and links to how to uninstall them.

### Review Browser History and Disable Notifications

To try and "replay" the attack it is a good idea to review the browser history of all of the victims installed browsers. This way you can try to piece together a story and potentially determine any other accounts or actions that might need to be taken. Also a common way to persistently try and scam individuals is by using browser notifications [1] to send alerts to the victim. It is best to review those as well.

Review history:

### Cleanup of Computer

While you are doing cleanup it is a good time to go through and review all of the installed apps on the victims computer. It is also a good idea to run a cleanup tool

1. Review installed apps and remove unused or suspicuous ones
2. Install and run [Malwarebytes Adware Cleaner](https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner)
3. Install all operating system updates and updates to other primary tools like Adobe Acrobat Reader and Microsoft Office
